# DeviceBatteryDetector

This JavaScript program creates a battery status indicator. Users can visually monitor the battery level and charging status of their devices.

How does it work?

1. Getting Battery Status: The battery status of the device is obtained using the navigator.getBattery() method.

2. Battery Status Update: When the battery status changes or the charging status changes, the battery level and charging status are updated.

3. Visual Appearance: Battery level is represented by a liquid-filled battery indicator. Additionally, the battery level is also displayed as a percentage.

4. Status Icons: Icons are displayed depending on whether the battery is full, charging, or low charged.

5. Color Change: The color of the battery indicator changes depending on the battery level. It turns red at low levels, orange at mid-levels, and green at high levels.
